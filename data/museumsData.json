"description": "The Cairo International Airport Museum-(Terminal 3) was inaugurated in 2016, in the light of the cooperation protocol between the Ministry of Antiquities and the Ministry of Civil Aviation, to serve as the initial introduction to ancient Egypt, and even the window overlooking its iconic monuments and its majestic civilization. The museum at that time occupied an area of approximately 60 square meters, and 38 objects were displayed in it. In 2020 the museum was transferred from its first location to the fourth floor in the same building, in order to display more objects, as its area occupies about 150 square meters. The museum currently displays a group of the most prominent objects through which the visitor can experience the incomparable history of Egypt through its various periods. The objects guide the visitor through the different phases of Egyptian history, starting with the pharaonic period, passing through the Greco-Roman period, and also present Coptic and Islamic art, and bring the visitor into the modern period.",

He was assigned as a doctor for the English military in 1904 and was deployed in Egypt in 1907.In 1935, Geyer Anderson submitted a request to the Assembly of Preserving Arab Antiquities to live in the two houses and to furnish them in Islamic-Arabic style. He proposed to gather a collection of pharaonic, Islamic, and Asiatic antiquities. These antiquities would belong to the Egyptian people following his death or when he left Egypt permanently. The assembly agreed. When Anderson left the house in 1942, his request was granted, and the two houses came into the possession of the Assembly of Preserving Arab Antiquities, which converted the building into the Geyer Anderson MuseumThe house is a combination of two houses dating to the Ottoman period (16-17th century).",

"name":" Graeco-Roman Museum",
"location":"Alexandria",
"description":"The Graeco-Roman Museum of Alexandria is one of Egypt's principal museums, the oldest building in Egypt to be architecturally designed for the purpose of preserving and displaying antiquities. Furthermore, it is the only museum fully dedicated to the antiquities and civilization of Egypt during the Greek and Roman eras  Since 1889, the Italian Giuseppe Botti sought to establish a museum for Alexandria that would protect its antiquities from displacement and destruction. He continued to work on that until the decision to establish the museum was issued on June 1, 1892. The museum began in a modest rented property, and Khedive Abbas Helmy II inaugurated it on 17 October 1892. Giuseppe Botti was its first director. Since its inception, the museum has sparked a cultural renaissance about interest in the city’s archaeological activities. Discoveries increased, and there became a pressing need for a new spacious building. On September 12, 1894, Nubar Pasha laid the cornerstone for the new museum to be built on land owned and adjacent to the Municipal Council. The new structure was designed by the architects Dietrich and Stenon in a neoclassical style. The construction process took one year, and it was inaugurated again by Khedive Abbas Helmy II on September 26, 1895. After Botti's death in October 1903, the management of the museum remained Italian, Evaristo Breccia took charge in April 1904, and Achille Adriani succeeded him from 1932 to 1940. from 1940-1947, the museum was run by Alan Rowe. from 1948 to 1953, Adriani took over management once more. Egyptian archaeologists have been in charge of the museum since 1953 onwardIn 1982, a development project was implemented for the museum, during which a new wing was added connecting the western and eastern wings. In September 2005, a decision was made to close the museum in order to carry out a comprehensive project to expand and develop the museum. The project stalled for ten years until work was resumed in April 2015. By creating an upper floor, a new interior design, and a new display scenario are applied ",

"description": "Mummification museum in Luxor (ancient Thebes), intended to provide an understanding of the process to preserve the body. The ancient Egyptians not only applied embalming to dead humans but also to many animals (Cats, dogs, crocodiles…. etc.). God Anubis(the Jackal) was the god of embalming and mummification.Mummification process is believed to have taken around 70 days, accompanied by many rituals. The organs of the deceased were carefully removed through a small incision (10 cm) in the left side of the body and preserved in Canopic jars. The body was then dried in sodium nitrate, or nitrate salt brought from Wadi El Natron, for about 40 days, and finally wrapped in bandages of linen. Magical amulets were placed within the wrappings on various parts of the body to protect the deceased. The family then received the body and placed it in a coffin for burial.The Mummification Museum provides a comprehensive view of the entire process through the display of many tools, objects and equipment used for the process, as well as, an explanation of the ritual and religious significance of the practice. Canopic jars, elaborately decorated coffins, mummified remains; amulets and statues of deities are among the many objects on display.",

"description":  "The Nubian Museum was founded in response to the international salvage campaign of the ancient Nubian monuments initiated by UNESCO upon the request of the Egyptian government in 1960. Work on establishing the Nubian Museum began in the early 1980s when a committee was formed comprising of specialists from the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egyptian universities, and UNESCO.The task of designing the building was entrusted to the architect Dr. Mahmoud Al-Hakim, and the museum’s interior was designed by the Mexican engineer Pedro Ramirez Vazquez, whose job it was to exhibit the archaeological, historical, cultural, and environmental heritage of Nubia. The Nubian Museum was opened in 1997, with its distinctive architectural design clad in local sandstone and pink granite, reflecting traditional local Nubian architecture. In 2001 it was awarded the Agha Khan Award for Islamic Architecture.The museum has three floors, exhibiting thousands of artefacts that shed light on the development of Egyptian and Nubian geographical, social, and cultural civilization. The main exhibition hall and diorama present the local traditions and handicrafts of Nubia. In addition to the exhibition galleries, the museum also holds a lecture hall, library, educational department, theatre, and an open amphitheatre for the presentation of Nubian folklore.The garden attached to the museum serves as an open-air museum that includes a part of a Fatimid cemetery, a cave with prehistoric rock inscriptions, and a waterway symbolizing the artery of ancient Egyptian civilization, the River Nile. A series of water channels demonstrates the relationship between the river and the Nubian village surrounded by plants that would have been common in ancient times. A reconstruction of a Nubian house offers a glimpse into the daily life of the Egyptians in Nubia",

"description":"The idea for the National Museum of Suez was conceived after the collapse of the older museum during the war in 1967. Its collection was moved to the storage rooms of the Egyptian Museum, on Tahrir Square.

The museum gives an account of the history of the city of Suez and its antiquities from prehistory to the modern era,The museum was opened on a trial basis in January 2012, but was not officially opened to the public due to the security conditions at that time. It was officially opened to receive visitors on September 29, 2014.The museum consists of two floors separated by an open exhibition hall that displays different styles of Greek, Roman and Islamic archaeological columns.The museum sheds light on the digging of the Suez Canal as well as other canals and their role in sea trade, such as the 'Canal of the Pharaohs' dug by Nekau II. It also highlights the spheres of mining and shipbuilding, Egypt’s commercial relationships, and the important part that Suez plays in the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). In addition to this is the mummification hall is one of the most important halls of the museum, as it simulates the cemetery from the inside and contains a complete depiction of the mummification process, including mummification tools, votive plaques, offering tables, and a group of colored coffins, in addition to a mummy of a priest with a magic spell.One of the most prominent objects is a statue of King Senwosret III dating to the Middle Kingdom (Twelfth Dynasty).

The museum was established through the efforts of Marcus Simaika Pasha, a prominent Coptic figure who was vested in the preservation of Coptic heritage. Simaika Pasha bought and collected Coptic antiquities and various architectural elements from older churches that were undergoing renovation, and used them to built the museum and establish its collection.The collection represents Coptic history from its earliest beginnings in Egypt through to its rise as a leading center of Christianity in the world. Coptic Christianity traces its origins to a visit by Saint Mark in the city of Alexandria in the 1st Century A.D. The artifacts on display in the museum show the merge of Coptic art with the prevailing cultures including Pharaonic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman, and its evolution in developing its own character and identity.Magnificently decorated manuscripts, icons, delicately carved woodwork and elaborate frescos with religious scenes recovered from ancient monasteries and churches are among its extensive collection.",

The museum displays an extensive collection spanning from the Predynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Era.The architect of the building was selected through an international competition in 1895, which was the first of its kind, and was won by the French architect, Marcel Dourgnon. The museum was inaugurated in 1902 by Khedive Abbas Helmy II, and has become a historic landmark in downtown Cairo, and home to some of the world’s most magnificent ancient masterpieces  Among the museum’s unrivaled collection are the complete burials of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette commemorating the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under one king, which is also among the museum’s invaluable artifacts. The museum also houses the splendid statues of the great kings Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the builders of the pyramids at the Giza plateau. An extensive collection of papyri, sarcophagi and jewelry, among other objects, completes this uniquely expansive museum.",

"name":"he Royal Carriages Museum",
"location":"Cairo",
"description": "The Royal carriages Museum in Boulaq is one of the earliest of its kind worldwide, both from the prospect of the authenticity of its building and the originality of its displays. The building was particularly adapted to preserve the cultural heritage of the royal carriages and all related material dating back to the era of Mohammed Ali Dynasty.The idea of establishing the museum building dates back to the reign of khedive Ismail (r. 1863- 1879), who thought of founding a special structure for housing the horses and the khedivial carriages. Initially, the establishment was called the “Khedivial Carriages Service”, then its name was changed in 1922 to “Royal Stables Department (Royal Mews)” under the reign of king Fouad  (r. 1917- 1936).Being the focus of royal attention, this establishment was provided with all specialized experts and skilled workers. The building was converted into a museum after the revolution of 1952.The Museum houses a unique collection, of which the most notable are various sizes and types of royal carriages, one of the most distinguished objects in the Museum is the grand Alay Carriage, which is characterized by its finest workmanship and elaborate decoration. It was the gift of Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Empress Eugenie to Khedive Ismail on the occasion of the Suez Canal inauguration in 1869. King Faruk ordered its restoration and used it on the inauguration of the Parliament in 1942, also its contain horse riding equipments, uniforms of the Carriages Service employees, as well as oil paintings dating to the same eraWorthy of note is that few museums all over the world are specialized in exhibiting this kind of displays, for examples museums in Austria, France, Russia, and England",
